    <h1>Wreck Diving</h1>
    <h2>R. George Klemperer</h2>
    <!-- h1 means top level heading -->
    <p>During the winter of 2022/23 I travelled to the Phillipines (where I was born: Cotabato City, 1994) for 10 weeks to travel around and learn more about the country. While there I spent a week in Coron bay where I learned to scuba dive and dived my first wrecks. I trained to dive to 30m depths, which gave a penetration time of around 15 minutes for some of the shallower wrecks on a normal 11L tank of normal air.</p>
    
    <p>The only wreck in the big 6 I did not dive during my time in Coron was the Irako, an extremely well intact Japanese Navy refridgerated supply ship that is perhaps the bay's most famous wreck. She sits upright 45 m deep, is reserved for very experienced wreck divers, and is referred to by local divemasters as "DDD" (deep, dark, and dangerous). Below 30 m gas narcosis is inevitable (a mild delirium caused by the pressure forcing more nitrogen from your air into your bloodstream). Therefore, The Irako's depth combined with its narrow labrynthian interior means it is especially respected, as well as revered, out of all the wrecks.</p>
    <p>The <b>"big 6"</b> wrecks in Coron Bay:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Olympia Maru</b>- auxillary supply ship, 122 meters long, 30 meters max hull depth</li>
        <li><b>The Morazan</b>- freighter, 93 meters long, 25 meters max hull depth</li>
        <li><b>Kogyo Maru</b>- freighter, 129 meters    long, 34 meters max hull depth</li>
        <li><b>Akitsushima</b>- seaplane tender, 115 meters long, 35 meters max hull depth</li>
        <li><b>Okikawa Maru</b>- oil tanker, 168 meters long, 26 meters max hull depth</li>
        <li><b>The Irako</b>- refrigerated supply ship, 147 meters long, 45 meters max hull depth</li>
      </ul>
