    <h1>Wreck Diving</h1>
    <h2>R. George Klemperer</h2>
    <!-- h1 means top level heading -->
    <p>During the winter of 2022/23 I travelled to the Phillipines (where I was born: Cotabato City, 1994) for 10 weeks to travel around and learn more about the country. While there I spent a week in Coron bay where I learned to scuba dive and dive my first wrecks. </p>
